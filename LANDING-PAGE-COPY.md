## Problem Section

### Headline
You know AI matters. You just don't know where to start.

### Problem Cards

**Card 1: The Course Trap**
You've tried courses. Generic content, fluff-filled videos, certificates that mean nothing. You learned ABOUT AI but never learned to USE it.

**Card 2: The Tool Overwhelm**
ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot... Thousands of tools, zero direction. Which ones matter for YOUR work?

**Card 3: The Secret User**
You're using AI "secretly" at work. No one taught you. No one validates your approach. Are you doing it right?

## How It Works Section

### Headline
Go from "I should use AI more" to "I'm the AI person on my team"

### Step 1: Assess
**5-minute skill assessment**
Discover where you stand across 6 core AI capabilities. No judgment—just a clear picture of your starting point.

### Step 2: Learn
**Daily curated content**
15 minutes of the best AI content on the internet, filtered for YOUR role. Videos, articles, tutorials—only what's actually useful.

### Step 3: Apply
**Real experiments for your job**
Each day includes a micro-experiment to try at work. Not theory—actual tasks you can complete today.

### Step 4: Grow
**Track your progress**
Watch your skills improve over time. Re-assess monthly. Build a portfolio of experiments that prove your capability.

## FAQ Section

### "Can't I just learn this from ChatGPT?"
You can. But will you? ChatGPT is your gym equipment. WorkStrata is your personal trainer. You could figure it out alone—but without structure, curriculum, and accountability, most people try for a week and stop.

### "I'm already using AI at work."
Great! But using AI and being AI-capable are different. We help you go from "I use ChatGPT sometimes" to "I have a systematic approach to AI-augmented work that I can articulate and prove."

### "Is $29/month worth it for emails?"
You're not paying for emails. You're paying for curation (we filter the noise), structure (skills-based curriculum), and accountability (daily habit). If you save 1 hour per week from better AI skills, that's $200/month in value at $50/hour.

### "AI changes so fast. Won't this be outdated?"
Exactly why courses fail—they're frozen in time. Our content is curated daily. And we teach skills (how to think with AI), not tools (which button to click). Skills transfer across whatever model is trending next month.

### "My job is too specialized for this."
Your job title is unique. Your tasks aren't. Everyone writes emails, summarizes information, does research, analyzes data, and communicates with others. We train the AI skills that apply to cognitive work everywhere.

### "What if AI replaces my job anyway?"
Then you definitely want to be the person who understands AI. The risk isn't learning too much about AI—it's being the person who doesn't. WorkStrata is career insurance.

## Notes for Implementation

1. Primary color: Keep current primary-600 (likely blue/purple)
2. Remove all emojis except in problem cards (per Mike's preference in app)
3. Keep animations subtle
4. Mobile-first responsive
5. Fast loading—no heavy images
6. CTA buttons should be prominent and consistent
