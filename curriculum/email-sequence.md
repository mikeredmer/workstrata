# 7-Day Trial Email Sequence

## Day 1: Welcome + Context Assembly

**Subject:** Day 1: The skill that separates AI pros from everyone else
**Preview:** Most people skip this step. Don't.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome to WorkStrata. You just made a smart move.

Over the next 7 days, you'll learn the 6 skills that separate people who *use* AI from people who get *real results* from AI.

Let's start with the most overlooked skill: **Context Assembly**.

Here's the truth: AI doesn't read minds. The quality of what you put IN determines the quality of what you get OUT. Most people give AI a vague request and wonder why they get generic garbage back.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Video/article on context assembly fundamentals]

Key insight: The best AI users spend 60% of their time on context, 40% on the actual prompt.

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Try this in your next AI interaction:

Before typing your request, write down:
1. What role should the AI play?
2. What does it need to know about your situation?
3. What does "good" look like?

Then include all three in your prompt. Compare the output to your usual approach.

---

**Your Progress:** Day 1 of 7 ✓

You're building a skill that 90% of professionals don't have. Keep going.

See you tomorrow,
The WorkStrata Team

## Day 2: Quality Judgment

**Subject:** Day 2: How to know if AI output is actually good
**Preview:** The dangerous skill gap nobody talks about

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 2. You're building momentum.

Yesterday you learned Context Assembly. Today: **Quality Judgment**—the skill that keeps you from shipping AI-generated garbage.

Here's the problem: AI sounds confident even when it's wrong. If you can't evaluate output quality, you're flying blind.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Article/video on evaluating AI output quality]

Key insight: Never ask "Is this good?" Ask "Would I stake my reputation on this?"

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Take something AI generated for you recently (or generate something new).

Run it through the Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Is every fact verifiable?
- [ ] Is the tone right for the audience?
- [ ] Would an expert spot obvious gaps?
- [ ] Does it actually answer the question asked?

Fix what fails. Notice how your standards sharpen.

**Your Progress:** Day 2 of 7 ✓✓

2 days in. The compound effect is starting.

## Day 3: Task Decomposition

**Subject:** Day 3: Why complex tasks break AI (and how to fix it)
**Preview:** The "chunking" technique that changes everything

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 3. Halfway through your first week.

Today's skill: **Task Decomposition**—breaking complex work into AI-sized pieces.

Most people throw entire projects at AI and get disappointed. "Write my business plan." "Create my marketing strategy." These fail because they're too big.

The pros break things down.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Video/article on task decomposition strategies]

Key insight: If a task takes a human more than 30 minutes, it's probably too big for one AI interaction.

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Pick a complex task you've been putting off.

Break it into 5-7 sub-tasks. Each should be:
- Completable in one AI session
- Have clear success criteria
- Build toward the whole

Do the first sub-task with AI. Notice how much better it works.

---

**Your Progress:** Day 3 of 7 ✓✓✓

You're developing real skills, not just tips. That's the difference.

See you tomorrow,
The WorkStrata Team

---

## Day 4: Iterative Refinement

**Subject:** Day 4: First drafts are just the beginning
**Preview:** The conversation technique that 10x's your output

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 4. You're in the groove now.

Today: **Iterative Refinement**—the art of conversation with AI.

Here's what separates amateurs from pros: Amateurs accept the first output. Pros treat it as draft one of five.

AI isn't a vending machine. It's a collaborator. Learn to direct it.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Video/article on iterative prompting techniques]

Key insight: "Make it better" is lazy. "Make it more concise, add a specific example, and strengthen the opening" is useful.

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Start a task with AI. When you get the first output:

1. Don't accept it
2. Identify the 2-3 weakest parts
3. Give specific feedback: "The intro is too generic. Reference [specific context]. The middle section needs data."
4. Repeat until it's genuinely good

Track how many iterations it takes. That number will decrease over time.

[→ See the full experiment guide]({{experiment_link}})

**Your Progress:** Day 4 of 7 ✓✓✓✓

More than halfway. These skills are becoming instinct.

## Day 5: Workflow Integration

**Subject:** Day 5: From "using AI" to "AI-powered workflow"
**Preview:** Stop context-switching. Start flowing.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 5. Three more days in your trial.

Today's skill changes everything: **Workflow Integration**—making AI part of how you actually work, not a separate tool you visit.

Right now, you probably use AI as a destination. You go TO it when you need something. That's friction. The goal: AI becomes invisible infrastructure.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Video/article on workflow integration patterns]

Key insight: The best AI users rarely think about "using AI." It's just part of how they work.

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Map your typical workday. Identify 3 recurring tasks where you could insert AI:

- Morning email processing
- Meeting prep
- End-of-day documentation
- Research for projects
- First drafts of anything

Pick ONE and make AI the default for the next week. Don't think about whether to use it—just use it.

[→ See the full experiment guide]({{experiment_link}})

---

**Your Progress:** Day 5 of 7 ✓✓✓✓✓

You've learned 5 of 6 core skills. This is substantial.

**Quick note:** Your trial ends in 2 days. If you're finding value, [continue your journey for $29/month]({{upgrade_link}}). No pressure—just wanted you to know.

## Day 6: Frontier Recognition

**Subject:** Day 6: Knowing what AI can't do (yet)
**Preview:** The skill that prevents expensive mistakes

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 6. Tomorrow is your last trial day.

Today's skill: **Frontier Recognition**—knowing where AI's capabilities end.

This matters more than people think. AI fails silently. It won't tell you "I can't do this well." It'll just give you confident-sounding garbage. You need to know the boundaries.

---

**📚 Today's Learning (5 min)**

[CONTENT: Video/article on AI limitations and frontier awareness]

Key insight: AI is great at synthesis, pattern-matching, and first drafts. It's bad at novel reasoning, real-time data, and anything requiring true expertise.

---

**🧪 Today's Experiment**

Think of a recent task where AI disappointed you.

Analyze WHY it failed:
- Did it require information AI couldn't have?
- Did it need genuine expertise or judgment?
- Was the task too ambiguous?
- Was it a limitation you could have anticipated?

Knowing why things fail is how you learn when NOT to use AI. That's as valuable as knowing when to use it.

[→ See the full experiment guide]({{experiment_link}})

**Your Progress:** Day 6 of 7 ✓✓✓✓✓✓

All 6 skills covered. Tomorrow: putting it all together.

## Day 7: Recap + The Path Forward

**Subject:** Day 7: You've learned more than you realize
**Preview:** What 7 days of focused AI skill-building actually means

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 7. Final day of your trial.

Let's look at what you've built:

✓ **Context Assembly** – You know that quality input = quality output
✓ **Quality Judgment** – You can evaluate AI work, not just accept it
✓ **Task Decomposition** – You break complex work into AI-sized pieces
✓ **Iterative Refinement** – You treat AI like a collaborator, not a vending machine
✓ **Workflow Integration** – You're building AI into how you actually work
✓ **Frontier Recognition** – You know where AI helps and where it can't

This isn't a checklist. It's a foundation. These 6 skills compound over time.

---

**📚 Today's Reflection**

No new content today. Instead:

Look back at your week. Which skill had the biggest impact? Which needs more practice?

The people who get real results from AI aren't smarter—they're more intentional about building these skills.

---

**🧪 Your Ongoing Experiment**

Keep a "win journal" for the next month. Every time AI saves you meaningful time or improves your work, write it down.

You'll be shocked at the cumulative impact.

---

**What Happens Now**

Your free trial ends today.

You have two options:

**Option 1: Stop here.**
You've got the foundations. Apply what you learned. No hard feelings.

**Option 2: Keep building.**
